This is the story of Mrs. X
Her mind numb, her thoughts twisted
A meeting, INCEPTION, BETRAYAL inbound
His actions
DUALITY, a blade with two sides
She thought knew something, yet she knew nothing
A FALLACY, the beginning of the end
Seclusion, detachment
A RAIN OF TEARS swept away
The last clear drops of wit
SORROW vanished
DESPAIR came in its place
DARK THOUGHTS rose in her
And INSANITY soon followed
WRATH fought its way
reality, only a possibility
a tunnel of darkness
she took a step
The knife flashed in the night
"
 Help me!
 Free me!
 Let me go!
 Oh come on kill me already!
"
42 stabs, one last scream
And the deed was done

What ATROCITY happened that day
forgotten, a bad dream
PREVARICATION
But soon she began to REALIZE
Alarming
the blood on her hands
still dripping on the floor
"
 Wait a second
 What have I done
 What have I become
 God
"
REGRET
"
 God I am a monster
 I am an ABOMINATION I'm going to hell
 I am an ABOMINATION I'll kill myself
 I am an ABOMINATION fucking hell
 I am an ABOMINATION can't look at my face
"
how could she live on?

And when she finally saw
He saved her,
His actions out of love
it was her mind
A VICIOUS CIRCLE of neverending thoughts
Only one thing was left to be done

This story ends here
with love as the cause of death
The last RESORT
two knights, one dark one bright
no one will remember
no one will mourn
PEACE at last
