This is the story of Mrs. X
her mind numb, her thoughts twisted
a victim of oppression
forever subdued
she lived in a city
where repression prevailed
feared the darkness
was always watching behind
a husband, powerless
claws from the shadows
grasping to crush
never found, obscured by the dark

There once was a meeting, secretly,
his actions DUALITY, a blade with two sides
flawed
a FALLACY, her reality
BETRAYAL inbound, the beginning of the end
seclusion, detachment
DESOLATION

A RAIN OF TEARS, bitterly swept away
the last clear drops of wit
SORROW vanished
DESPAIR seized its reign

DEPRAVITY, her thoughts a trap
Retreat not possible
growing more wicked with each second
reality, only a possibility
shrouded by a thick fog
Impervious
a desperate STRIVE FOR RESISTANCE
breaking away
remembering the sorrow
a spiral downwards
WRATH and hate fought their way
finally descending into INSANITY

one scheme claimed the throne
she took a step
the knife flashed in the night
"
 Help me!
 Free me!
 Let me go!
"
"
 You are the loss of my life, now die!
"
42 stabs, one last scream
and the deed was done

What ATROCITY took place that day
forgotten, a bad dream
PREVARICATION, elusion

But soon, the REALIZATION
alarming
the blood on her hands
still dripping on the floor
she looked at them, in fear
"
 Wait a second
 What have I done
 What have I become
 My god
"
REGRET
"
 God I am a monster
 I am an ABOMINATION what have I done
 I am an ABOMINATION what have I become
 I am an ABOMINATION I need to escape
 I am an ABOMINATION this fucking hell
 BLEGH
"
how could she live on?

And when the truth finally dawned upon
he saved her,
his actions out of love
a desperate agreement, money for life
an attempt to satisfy the treacherous shadows
it was her mind, a VICIOUS CIRCLE
deeper and deeper
into the abyss of chaos and wickedness 
only one thing was left to be done

This story ends here
with love as the cause of death
the last RESORT
two knights, one dark one bright
forever gone
surrendered to the shadows
no REMEMBRANCE
RESOLUTION?
only void, nothing remains
PEACE at last
