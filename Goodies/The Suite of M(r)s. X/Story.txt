This is the story of Mrs. X
her mind numb, her thoughts twisted
a victim of oppression
forever subdued

There once was a meeting, secretly,
his actions DUALITY, a blade with two sides
she thought she knew something, yet she knew nothing
a FALLACY, her reality
BETRAYAL inbound, the beginning of the end
seclusion, detachment
DESOLATION

A RAIN OF TEARS, bitterly swept away
the last clear drops of wit
SORROW vanished
DESPAIR seized its reign

DEPRAVITY, her thoughts a trap
Retreat not possible
growing darker and darker
finally descending into INSANITY

WRATH fought its way	
reality, only a possibility
obscured by a thick fog
impervious
one scheme claimed the throne
she took a step
the knife flashed in the night
"
 Help me!
 Free me!
 Let me go!
"
"
 You are the loss of my life, now die!
"
42 stabs, one last scream
and the deed was done

What ATROCITY took place that day
forgotten, a bad dream
PREVARICATION, elusion

But soon, the REALIZATION
alarming
the blood on her hands
still dripping on the floor
she looked at them, in fear
"
 Wait a second
 What have I done
 What have I become
 My god
"
REGRET
"
 God I am a monster
 I am an ABOMINATION what have I done
 I am an ABOMINATION who am I
 I am an ABOMINATION I'll kill myself
 I am an ABOMINATION I'm going to hell
 BLEGH
"
how could she live on?

And when the truth finally dawned upon
he saved her,
his actions out of love
a desperate agreement, money for life
dark hands dictating the course
never found in the neverending void
it was her mind, a VICIOUS CIRCLE
deeper and deeper into the abyss
only one thing was left to be done

This story ends here
with love as the cause of death
the last RESORT

two knights, one dark one bright
forever gone
no REMEMBRANCE
no GRIEF
PEACE at last
