This is the story of Mrs. X
Her mind numb, her thoughts twisted
A meeting, INCEPTION, BETRAYAL inbound
His actions
DUALITY, a blade with two sides
She knew something, yet she knew nothing
A FALLACY, the beginning of the end 
A RAIN OF TEARS swept away
The last clear drops of wit
SORROW vanished
DESPAIR came in its place
And INSANITY soon followed
DARK THOUGHTS rose in her
WRATH fought its way
reality, only a possibility
a tunnel of darkness
she took a step
The knife flashed in the night
Help me!
Free me!
Let me go!
Kill me already!
13 stabs, one last scream
And the deed was done

What ATROCITY happened that day
forgotten, a bad dream
PREVARICATION
But soon she began to REALIZE
the blood on her hands
still dripped on the floor
REGRET
A monster, ABOMINATION
how could she live on?

And when she finally found out
He saved her,
His actions out of love
it was her mind
A VICIOUS CIRCLE of neverending thoughts
Only one thing was left to be done

This story ends here
with love as the cause of death
two knights, one dark one bright
no one will remember
no one will sorrow
The last RESORT
PEACE at last
