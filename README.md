# Atlas Descending

Hi guys, thanks for checking out my repo!

*TL;DR:*  
this repo is a collection of my self-written music and I want to share it with you using this platform. Have fun exploring it!

*Longer explanation:*  
Besides all the studying and coding I am a guitarist and am playing multiple additional instruments like drums, bass, piano, melodica, harmonica and a lot of percussion. I absolutely love music (look at my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/w2on4iq7y2j9cw928mivcrf9c?si=e2792517e44c4d1e) profile) and started writing music back in the days when I took guitar lessons. With time the riffs got better, the songs longer and more complex and my taste in music went from "Rock only!" to a variety of genres starting way back in time (folklore from ancient times), passing everything from the baroque, classical and romantic era to modern music, including early blues and jazz in the beginning of the 20th century, Rock 'n' Roll from the 50s to today including the glorious Woodstock era, 80s' party music, new punk beginning in the 90ties, Indie in all its facettes and getting closer to my main taste in music, metal. Scooter is my guilty pleasure and even some chart songs are in my playlist as well. Did I mention dubstep, too? Damn the list becomes longer every day (and my [##Absolute Best##](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07x1lpoI77AKsmWtqJIGaR?si=0081befc9c4a49df) as well as my Liked Songs playlist, too).

I think it is important to be open minded towards new genres, new impressions and new ideas of people who love making music and sharing it. You just miss out if you stick to the same stuff for all the years (but even so, still better than not listening to music at all :O). A rule I told myself is: there is no bad music. There is music you don't understand, there is music that gives you a headache, there even is music you simply don't like, but no music is in particular "bad". So try to listen to a song when someone tells you they like it, try to just experience it. You would do the same with food and drinks, right? Take a taste, spit it out (great song, too, thanks @Slipknot) and take another to be sure you don't like it. And eventually you will find stuff that weirdly soothes you, pumps you (or the jam) up, which tastes like something completely new and unexperienced before and you're glad you didn't miss it in your life. Or you just don't like it and that's fine as well.

Be that as it may and to argue with you (because I know you want to), in my opinion the genre with the largest spectrum is metal (hear me out, jesus) since there are songs even old grumpy people know and like and which are played on mainstream radio on the one hand and songs you can cut throats of screaming goats to and people would rather listen to the screams of the goats on the other. I mean seriously, there's a lot in between, a LOT, and each and every small facette on the spectrum exists as a genre inside of metal itself! Saying metal is only loud music and screaming is like saying every ice cream is made of milk and therefore tastes the same. Firstly, no, secondly, no!

Anyways, I kept my self-written stuff a secret for a very long time without any special reason, because come on, if you want to steal it do so, I will find you anyway (hehe). This is the platform I want to share it on for the first time. This repository is everything I have written so far mostly using Guitar Pro and MuseScore and includes completed songs, a lot of song parts and even more riffs for guitar, bass, drums and piano spanning multiple genres. You can listen to the stuff in your own pace and if you find something very nice or really really bad (most stuff is only really bad) then you can tell me that, I would be very happy to hear how you experienced the stuff!
